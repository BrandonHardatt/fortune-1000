Comment 1: 
For the next iteration please point for each cell where they belong in the marking scheme to help me. For example, Iteration 1 â€“ part 1, etc.

Response: 
For this iteration we will specify each of the cells related to marking.  

Comment 2:
Is the technique to find outliers proper? Was it justified? (25 marks) 
15 marks. Fellows, for a skewed distribution it is not a good idea to go with mean-std strategies. 
Remember that a mean is not an adequate central measurement, you should have used a median-based strategy. 
In your case, you could have removed values above percentile 95 (or something like that).

Response:
For this iteration we will be using the IQR method to detect outliers instead of the 3 x std since the distribution isskewed
