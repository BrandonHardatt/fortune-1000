# Fortune 1000
Every year Fortune, an American Business Magazine, publishes the Fortune 500, which ranks the top 500 corporations by revenue. 
However, the dataset used for this study includes all 1000 companies, as opposed to just the top 500.

The Fortune 1000 dataset used for this study has been taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/winston56/fortune-500-data-2021), and contains U.S. company data for the year 2021, with market valuations determined on January 20,2021.
